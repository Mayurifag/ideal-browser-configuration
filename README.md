# Ideal browser configuration [WIP]

## Motivation

There is no «ansible»-provisioning-way to install favourite browser and its
extensions, so I made this repository as a cheatsheet.

## What browser to pick

There are not too many browser choices nowadays: you may choose either
Chromium-based or Firefox-based forks.

My favourite ones (if I need a bit of privacy related settings) are:

1. LibreWolf (Firefox fork) <https://librewolf-community.gitlab.io/install/>
2. Ungoogled Chromium <https://github.com/Eloston/ungoogled-chromium>
3. Firefox Beta (if you dont respect vasyan-like forks like LibreWolf)
<https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/channel/desktop/>

I'm okay with LibreWolf, because I don't like Chromium and I respect
pre-configured privacy settings from LibreWolf, comparing to vanilla FF.

## LibreWolf configuration, the hard way
